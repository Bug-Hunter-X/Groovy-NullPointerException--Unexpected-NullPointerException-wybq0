This repository demonstrates an unexpected NullPointerException in Groovy.  Even though the `myMethod` explicitly checks for a null parameter, a NullPointerException is still thrown. This is because the null check is performed before any potential implicit type coercion that might occur. 

The solution shows how to modify the method to avoid this issue by handling nulls appropriately or by explicitly defining the parameter type.
